# UI Polishes Applied - Summary

## ✅ All Requested Changes Completed

### 1. Albanian Proverb Pronunciation (Footer)
- **Mobile text size reduced**: Changed from text-lg to text-base on mobile
- **Pronunciation text**: Reduced from 10px to 8px on mobile 
- **Better spacing**: Tighter gap-x-1 on mobile for full visibility
- **Result**: Entire proverb with pronunciation now fits on mobile screens

### 2. Tour Card Price Section
- **Layout fixed**: Changed from center-aligned to justify-between
- **Horizontal layout**: Price on left, "View Details →" on right
- **Consistent across all cards**: Both SSR and dynamic JavaScript cards updated

### 3. Tour Card Badges & Countries
- **Badge padding improved**: Added px-2.5 (from px-2) for better spacing
- **Country badges**: Changed to rounded-md with px-2.5 padding
- **Gap improved**: gap-1.5 between country badges for symmetry
- **Conditional rendering**: Only shows sections when data exists

### 4. Mobile Hero Overlay Improvements  
- **Rating badge size**: Reduced to w-3 h-3 on mobile (from w-3.5)
- **Text size**: Rating text reduced to 10px on mobile
- **Badge positioning**: Closer to edges (top-3 right-3) on mobile
- **Featured badge**: Truncated text on mobile to save space
- **Background opacity**: Lighter overlay (90% vs 95%) on mobile

### 5. Visual Consistency
- **Padding consistency**: All badges now have uniform padding
- **Border radius**: Consistent use of rounded-md on mobile, rounded-lg on desktop
- **Color consistency**: Maintained brand colors throughout
- **Typography scale**: Proper responsive sizing for all text elements

## Responsive Breakpoints Used
- **Mobile**: Default styles (< 640px)
- **Small**: sm: prefix (≥ 640px) 
- **Medium**: md: prefix (≥ 768px)
- **Large**: lg: prefix (≥ 1024px)

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Mobile-first approach**: Smaller sizes by default, enhanced on larger screens
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Hide decorative elements (emojis) on mobile
3. **Truncation strategy**: Shorten badge text on mobile while maintaining meaning
4. **Subtle overlays**: Reduced opacity on mobile to let photos shine through
5. **Consistent spacing**: Systematic padding/margin approach for visual harmony
