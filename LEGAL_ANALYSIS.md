  1. Avoid language suggesting control or endorsement
  2. Remove any "recommended" or "verified" badges
  3. Add "Third-Party Operator" labels prominently

#### C. Negligent Misrepresentation
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Current Mitigation**: Disclaimers about information accuracy
- **Additional Actions Needed**:
  1. Add data source attributions
  2. Include "Information may be outdated" warnings
  3. Implement regular content review schedule

### Medium Priority Risks

#### D. GDPR/Privacy Compliance
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Current Status**: Privacy policy exists

  3. Document data retention policies

#### E. Accessibility (ADA/WCAG)

## 2. LEGAL FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

### Strengths of Current Implementation

1. **Clear Jurisdictional Clause**: Dallas County, Texas provides business-friendly legal environment
2. **Comprehensive Risk Enumeration**: Specific listing of risks strengthens assumption of risk defense
3. **Multiple Reinforcement Points**: Disclaimers appear in multiple locations
4. **Indemnification Clause**: Strong protection against third-party claims
5. **Limitation Period**: One-year statute of limitations is enforceable in Texas

### Potential Vulnerabilities

1. **Conspicuousness**: Courts may scrutinize whether disclaimers are sufficiently prominent
2. **Actual vs. Constructive Notice**: Need proof users actually saw disclaimers
3. **Gross Negligence Exception**: Texas law doesn't allow waiver of gross negligence liability
4. **Minor Protection**: Disclaimers may not be enforceable against minors

## 10. CONCLUSION

The implemented legal framework provides strong protection for AlbaniaVisit.com, but requires proper integration and ongoing maintenance. The multi-layered approach (terms, disclaimers, modals, tracking) creates multiple defensive positions. However, no disclaimer is 100% bulletproof, and the company should still maintain appropriate insurance coverage and legal counsel relationships.

### Priority Actions
1. Integrate disclaimer components into live site
2. Implement acceptance tracking
3. Review with Texas-licensed attorney
4. Obtain appropriate insurance
5. Formalize partner relationships

### Risk Rating After Implementation
- **Current Risk**: HIGH
- **After Phase 1-2**: MEDIUM
- **After Full Implementation**: LOW-MEDIUM
- **With Insurance**: LOW
