5. Test all responsive breakpoints
6. Verify sticky elements work correctly
7. Check console for errors

## KNOWN AREAS OF CONCERN

Based on code analysis, pay special attention to:

1. **HeroGallery Thumbnails**: The thumbnail strip uses `justify-start` which may cause asymmetrical layouts
2. **Modal Overlays**: Multiple modals (booking + inquiry) need testing for conflicts
3. **Responsive Images**: Full-width gallery images need careful testing across devices
4. **Button Consistency**: Multiple button styles need verification for consistency
5. **Grid Alignments**: Tour cards need height consistency testing

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

The application passes testing if:
- All interactive elements function correctly
- No console errors during normal usage
- Responsive design maintains visual hierarchy at all screen sizes
- Critical user flows (booking, inquiry) work end-to-end
- Design consistency is maintained throughout
- Performance is acceptable for typical user interactions

## NEXT STEPS

1. Execute manual testing following this checklist
2. Document all findings with screenshots
3. Categorize issues by severity (Critical, Major, Minor)
4. Provide actionable recommendations for fixes
5. Verify fixes after implementation
