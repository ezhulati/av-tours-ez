  - paragraph: "\"The house of an Albanian belongs to the guest and to God.\""
  - paragraph: A centuries-old Albanian proverb rooted in the 15th-century Kanun code. It encapsulates the nation's legendary tradition of hospitality and generosity toward visitors. In Albanian culture, any guest — even a stranger or former enemy — is treated with profound honor, almost as if welcomed by God Himself. For travelers, this proverb offers reassurance that they will be greeted warmly and generously in Albania, reflecting a deeply ingrained cultural tradition of honoring and caring for every guest.
